Lesson 1
	Two modes of mind
		Focused
		Diffused
	Sleeping is very-very important
	
Week 2
	Part 1
		Topics: Chunks, Illusions of learning competence, Overlearning
		
		Video 2
			Chunking - composition of a new thought, idea or concept from smaller elements
			Smaller chunks can formulate bigger chunk
			The word "pop" is a chunking of letter 'p','o','p' and it results in an idea of particular action
			Stress, fear, angriness, etc prevents chunking
			Basic step for an academic learning is to build conceptual chunks
			Chunk - a chain of neurons that fires together, so you can think a thought smoothly and effeciently
			The path to expertise - is to build a little by little chunks, so they can become larger
			Chunking provides a way to wrap thing with many details into one simple thing
			Chunk is a metal leap that unite scattered bits of information
			
			Main idea: new material is studied and becomes undestandable by chunks
			
		Video 3
			To undestand whole new material, you usually explore it by steps and then bit by bit start see a whole picture
			Example with solutions is a good way to start as it is possible to see why each step works. Later you can explore the binding between steps
			Best chunks are uncounsiocness

			Chunking for metal ideas:
				Step 1: Focused attention
				Step 2: Understanding
				Step 3: Practice
			Mistake: refuse to continue reading if you don't understand details of current chapter
			Next step after forming a chunk - understand context
			Learn bottom up and top down
			Technique: Walk throught pictures and formulas of the chapter before reading it
			
		Video 5
			Recall helps a lot in understanding material(much better than reread or drawing pictures)
			Illusion of competence - if a book is in front of you, the material cam seem very simple, but thats not the case
			Technique: Testing youself
			Mistake are good, they provide feed back and can prevent illusions of competence
			Highliting the text is not good. Try to formulate may thought for paraghaph or use notes
			Reading-recall pattern - great way to build chunks
			While building chunk RAM have a lot of work and for example take 4 slots. When it is done - an idea starts to occupy 1 slots, so other slots are free
			Switch between focused and diffused mode
			Recall(!!!) in different place
			
			Main idea: recall is best technique to keep in touch with new information
			
	Part 2
		Video 1 (What motivates you)
			Acetylcholine affects focused learning
			Dopamine is responsible for pleasure by illusions(what drugs do)
			Serotonin - social life and risk taking behavior
		Video 2
			Chunks can form collections or library of solutions
			In defuse mode several chunks can compose new chunk to provide solutin
			2 way of problem solving:
				- Sequential(Focused)
				- Holistic(Global)
					Should be late verified by sequential
		Video 3
			Interleaving!
			Einstuller - installed blocks, preventing new ideas
			Deliberate practice - focusing on most difficult things
			Overlearning - repeating same material over and over, reaching automaticy(sometimes good, sometimes not)
Week 3
	Procrastination has a huge impact on learning and life
		Use pomadoro
		Master your habits
	Habits step
		The cue
		Routine
		Reward
		Belief
	Focusing on Process is natural
	Focusing on Produt can bring pain
	The cue can be
		location
		time
		feeling
		reactions
	Routine
		Have a plan!
	Reward
		Anything you like! Cup of coffee, evening with friends without guilty
	Belief
		Cultivate belief in these techniques
	Prepare a before-day to-do list, to free memory for sleep time
	Write the quit time in the list
	Get a key task list for a week
	Start the day with most difficult tasks
	Apply your willpower to cue, that starts the routine
	Studing 10 minutes everyday is much better than 1 our for single day
	Use card to remember(Anki)
	Visualize study material like formulas(f=m*a, flying mule)
	BrainQuake - math games for kids
